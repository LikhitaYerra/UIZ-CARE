# IUZ Care - AI-Powered ICD Code Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **IUZ Care** project is designed to automate and enhance the **ICD code assignment** process in healthcare using **AI and machine learning**. The goal is to help healthcare professionals efficiently generate **ICD codes** from diagnostic descriptions, reducing manual effort and administrative workload.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Healthcare professionals spend significant time manually assigning **ICD codes**, leading to:
- **Errors and inconsistencies** in code assignments
- **Delays** in medical record management
- **Increased administrative burden**

Our solution leverages AI to automatically **recommend the most accurate ICD codes**, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Develop an **AI-driven recommendation system** for **ICD code generation**.
- Improve the efficiency of **medical record management**.
- Provide **real-time ICD code suggestions** for healthcare professionals.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection** 📂
   - Obtained datasets from **WHO ICD database** and company-provided diagnostic reports.
   - Downloaded **ICD-11 codes** from WHO [here](https://icd.who.int/browse11/Downloads/Download?fileName=simpletabulation.zip).

2. **Preprocessing & Exploration** 🔍
   - Cleaned and structured medical data.
   - Performed **data visualization** to understand common **disease patterns**.

3. **Model Development** 🤖
   - Built a **recommendation system** using **AI & machine learning**.
   - The system predicts **the most relevant ICD code** based on a given diagnosis.

4. **Evaluation & Validation** ✅
   - Tested model performance and accuracy.
   - Fine-tuned the system for better predictions.

## 📊 Results & Findings
- The system provides **probabilistic ICD code recommendations** based on input diagnoses.
- Initial tests show that **France** has the highest representation in the dataset.
- Commonly detected illnesses include **bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression**.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Improve model **accuracy & adaptability** for diverse datasets.
- Integrate an **API for real-time ICD code recommendations**.
- Expand to **multilingual support** for global applications.
